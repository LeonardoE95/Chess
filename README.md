# Chess
Chess implementation in C using SDL2.

**DISCLAIMER**: It is still a work in progress, so mind it. When I'm done I will eventually make a playlist (in italian) on my [youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZe2cxQNCvgkQxUuqsIaig) detailing how I implemented it, step by step.

# Dependencies

The only dependencies (for now) are SDL2 and SDL2_IMG.

In arch these can be installed with

```
sudo pacman -S sdl2
sudo pacman -S sdl2_image
```

once you have those simply clone the repo and do the following

```
cd ./src
make
./main
```
